How To Lose Fat Without Losing Muscle – Burn Fat, NOT Muscle

- Can you lose your muscle mass while only trying to lose body fat? Yep, it’s happened to me and countless others plenty of times, and it can definitely happen to you

- People often say they want to lose weight. This is sort of a dumb statement, because “weight” can be a few different things. For example… water, glycogen, muscle or fat.

- The caloric deficit is the major requirement (consuming less than your body needs to perform its tasks for the day)

- You might want for your body to just burn the fat, but your body doesn’t really give a crap about what you want and only functions towards survival under the current conditions. From this it will need to pull stored energy from somewhere, and that can mean fat, muscle or a combination of both

1. Eat enough Protein

	- A sufficient daily protein intake is the single most important dietary requirement for maintaining muscle

2. Maintain Strength/Intensity/Weight On The Bar

	- the primary training stimulus required for maintaining muscle is maintaining your current levels of strength

	- On a fat loss diet just maintaining your current levels of strength (aka intensity, aka the weight on the bar) is what now signals your body to maintain muscle
	
	- If that signal goes away, your body’s need to keep your pretty muscle tissue around goes away right along with it

		*That’s why the insanely stupid myth of lifting heavier weights to build muscle but then lifting lighter weights (for higher reps) when you want to lose fat, get lean and get toned is the absolute WORST thing you could possibly believe when you’re trying to avoid losing muscle
		
		*In reality, you lift heavy weight to build muscle, and then lift that same heavy weight if you want to actually maintain that muscle
		
	- Sure you can continue trying to get stronger and continue trying to make progressive overload happen while losing fat. It can and does happen (especially for beginners, who should still be progressing consistently even in a deficit)

3. Reduce Weight Training Volume and/or Frequency

	- A caloric deficit is really an energy deficit, and while this is fantastic (and required) for losing any amount of body fat, it eliminates energy for the rest of your time and life
	
	- If not reduced, this regimine can actually lead to strength loss (lifting a lot with insufficient energy available!)
	
4. Get Pre & Post Workout Nutrition Right… Still

	- Pre and Post workout nutrition is centered on the maximization of effect in training and recovery from training periods, which is directly aligned with your weight loss plan's point of excercize - maximizing effect of this time spent!

5. Don’t Reduce Calories By TOO Much

	- A moderate deficit of about 20% below maintenance level is what ends up being most ideal in most cases
	
	- Reducing your calorie intake by TOO much will increase the potential for strength and muscle loss

8. Avoid Excessive Amounts Of Cardio (Or Just Don’t Do ANY At All)
